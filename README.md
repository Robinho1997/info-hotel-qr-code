Because this project will be avaible via a qr code I built it with mobile in mind.
So it will not look the best on desktop because the guests will view it on their mobile device.


[# info-hotel-qr-code](https://hotel-am-helmwartsturm-information.netlify.app)

This project is a single page web site which will be avaible via a qr code in the hotel lobby.

The task of this site is to inform the guests of the hotel with information about
- the hotel
- restaurants 
- attractions

I built this project with Javascript, HTML & CSS.
